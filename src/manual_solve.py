# Solve  functions commonalities or differences among them .
"""
Goal: To fill in the blank spaces without breaking pattern.
The 3 tasks that are solved as a part of this assignment had few common grounds 
    * All 3 could be solved with the use use of numpy and basic python loop knowledge 
    * All had a pattern which although different from each other while 
        carefully studying the matrix solution could be formed. 
    
The tasks did have different patterns in their grids which did differentiate the methods or grid traversing techniques
that could be used to fill the blank spaces
    * solve_484b58aa : Had a same pattern running through column , but each column could have a different pattern
        Complexity arose from the fact that the pattern could have repetitions of elements too.
    * solve_73251a56 : Had a diagonal symmetry , there was also symmetry between rows and column due to same. The 
        complexity to this problem had to be the issue where a good piece of chunk would be missing around diagonal hence
        symmetry concept would not work there to fill in the blank cell so had a carefully choose a color around 0 to fill in.
    * solve_c3f564a4 :For this task there was symmetry in rows and columns but not via the diagonal.The pattern was of same
        length and same fashioned list elements through out the matrix. So it was easy to find a pattern that suits the whole grid
        and use the same to find which color to use to fill in the blank.
        
Goal: To fill in the blank spaces without breaking pattern.
To quote from the On the Measure of Intelligence from Francois Chollet -"the only intelligence at work here is the engineerâ€™s"
The solutions that are mentioned in this might not work for edge cases as we assume the patterns and grid size
will be same. The algorithm is trained to solve few test scenarios and might not work well for a vast variety of samples .
Also the measure of success is  binary either the whole grid matches or it does not and the result is True or False respectively.
While initially developing a solution the algorithm might generate a grid as close as 90% matching to the expected output, but that
is not taken into account.

    """" Description: For this solution we see there is a varied length pattern found in each column. We get the
    pattern for each and then go on recreating the appending the new created column using the same pattern.
    Real challenge was to find a pattern and its size as each each row had its unique pattern and colors.

    Solution: The essence really lies in understanding the pattern. First intuition was that the pattern is in the
    rows but for few cases where the row starts with  multiple 0's or that pattern is not available at one stretch
    the algorithm did not work. Switched to columns for better pattern matching. Key point to note that the number of
    unique colors in a column/row which was also same across matrix was also equal to the pattern length. Once it was
    realised the pattern length to match was easier to find. A handy small method was created
    create_new_column_484b58aa to recreate columns per the pattern.
    * Find the column to be processed which has a zero
    * Create a pattern by looking into a continuous stream of numbers which are non-zero
    * Re create the column with the pattern found and return the new matrix

    Description: The symmetry was a key feature for this problem. The diagonal running from left to right had same
    element on the opposite side.The elements with position matrix[row][column] that are diagonally opposite to
    matrix[column][row] were easy to fill in , if not blank.
    The left over were the ones that did not find a non empty  cell opposite to diagonal element.
    They were usually around the diagonal and by looking around matrix[row][column] the ones which are not blank
    or 0 and if not a diagonal we get the color we want to fill in the blank spot with.

    Solution:
    Steps Taken to fill the matrix:
